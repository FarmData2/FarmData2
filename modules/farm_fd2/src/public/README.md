# FarmData2

The FarmData2 module aims to extend [farmOS](https://www.drupal.org/project/farm) by adding data input forms, reporting, and analytics that support the day-to-day operation of diversified vegetable farms. The data input forms and reporting facilitate the keeping of records necessary for organic certification and for the study of sustainable farming practices.
