# FarmData2

FarmData2 aims to support the day-to-day operation of diversified vegetable farms while facilitating the record keeping necessary for organic certification and for the study of sustainable farming practices. For example, forms like those shown below provide quick data entry for operations at the time they occur:

<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="docs/images/TraySeeding.jpg"><img src="docs/images/TraySeeding.jpg" alt="The Tray Seeding Form" width="200" /></a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <a href="docs/images/Transplanting.jpg"><img src="docs/images/Transplanting.jpg" alt="The Transplanting Form" width="200" /></a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <a href="docs/images/DirectSeeding.jpg"><img src="docs/images/DirectSeeding.jpg" alt="The Direct Seeding Form" width="200" /></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

FarmData2 is not currently ready for production use. We are actively working toward supporting a full growing season including seeding (tray, direct, cover crop), transplanting, soil amendment and disturbance, and harvesting.

## User Requirements & Installation

FarmData2 is a plugin module for [farmOS](https://www.drupal.org/project/farm) and requires a running instance of farmOS (3.0 or later) and an internet connection.

If you are familiar with hosting docker and database-backed websites you can [host your own instance of farmos](https://farmos.org/hosting/install/). The latest release of the [FarmData2 Drupal Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/farmdata2) can then be installed into your existing farmOS instance.

For those preferring a managed approach [Farmier](https://farmier.com/) offers a subscription service where they will create and host a farmOS instance for you. FarmData2 hopes to be available on Farmier hosted instances of farmOS in the near future.
