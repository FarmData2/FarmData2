# Native Install of the FarmData2 Development Tools

Use of the FarmData2 Development Environment, either via GitPod or a local install is encouraged. However, if you strongly prefer to work directly on your local machine it is in theory possible to install all of the necessary dependencies natively. This is a much more labor intensive process and you may encounter significant difficulties that are dependent upon the versions of software installed on your local machine.

This approach is not currently supported by the project maintainers.

However, the [developer native install stream](https://farmdata2.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/434384-developer-native-install) has been create as a community forum on the [FarmData2 Zulip](https://farmdata2.zulipchat.com/) for those pursuing this approach to collaborate and share information and tips.
