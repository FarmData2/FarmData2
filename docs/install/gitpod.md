## Creating a FarmData2 Development Environment Workspace

Use the following steps to create a FarmData2 Development Environment in a _GitPod workspace_:

1. Sign up for a free [GitPod account](https://gitpod.io/login/).
   - Use your GitHub credentials to log in.
     - The free account provides 50 hours/week of usage. More hours [can be purchased at a reasonable rate](https://gitpod.io/pricing).
1. Visit the [GitPod Preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/preferences) page.
   1. Under "New Workspaces," set the "default editor" to be "Terminal,"
   1. Under "Timeouts," set the "Default Workspace Timeout" to be 10m.
      - This will automatically shut down your workspace after 10 minutes of inactivity and will prevent you from wasting your free hours.
1. Fork the [upstream FarmData2 repository](https://github.com/FarmData2/FarmData2) in GitHub.
1. Copy the URL of your fork. This URL should have your GitHub username in it.
1. Visit the [new GitPod workspace page](https://gitpod.io/new) and paste the URL of your FarmData2 fork into the "Select a repository" search box and click the search result.
1. Click "Continue."
1. After about 2-5 minutes a terminal window will open in your browser. This document will call this terminal the _GitPod Terminal_.
   1. The GitPod Terminal will display information about starting the FarmData2 Development Environment, including about "Starting containers."
   1. After another 2-3 minutes the containers will have started and the GitPod Terminal will display information about how to connect to the FarmData2 Development Environment.
      You can connect to the FarmData2 Development Environment in two ways:
      - Connect by using your web browser by clicking the `https` link given in the output and then clicking the "Connect" button on the page that appears. See the [Connect Using Your Web Browser](connecting.md#connect-using-your-web-browser) section for more information.
      - Connect by using a VNC client by following the instructions in the output. See the [Connect Using a VNC Client](connecting.md#connect-using-a-vnc-client) section for more information.
        - When you run the shh command provided by the GitPod Terminal, if it asks for a password, close the terminal and visit [Gitpod's guide to create a SSH key](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh). Once you have created a SSH key, follow the instructions below to stop and restart the Development Environment. 
1. Follow the directions to [Setup the FarmData2 Development Environment](setup.md)
1. Visit [your GitPod workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/)
   - Your "farmdata2" workspace will appear here with a <!-- vale RedHat.DoNotUseTerms = NO : green is associated with the dot -->green<!-- vale RedHat.DoNotUseTerms = YES --> dot to its left, indicating that the workspace is running.
